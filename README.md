# FireOPS 🔥🧑‍🚒

A fire-response dispatch and incident-management system built for the Bureau of Fire
Protection (BFP). FireOPS gives dispatchers a real-time web command center and gives
field personnel a companion mobile app, tied together by a FastAPI backend that plans
optimal fire-truck routes using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained on local road data.

> This repository holds the **web dashboard** and **backend**. The personnel mobile app
> (React Native / Expo) lives in a separate `bfp_capstone_mobile/` project.

## What it does

- **Incident intake & mapping** — Log fire incidents, view them on a live Leaflet map
  with heatmaps, station coverage isochrones, and predicted road constraints.
- **AI routing** — A GNN-based routing engine plans fastest truck routes over the Panabo
  road network, accounting for narrow roads and traffic-crowded areas predicted by the model.
- **Dispatch & teams** — Auto-dispatch selects the best available response team/truck,
  then tracks the crew live as they head to the scene.
- **Live tracking & deviations** — Personnel positions stream in over WebSocket; the
  backend detects when a manned truck deviates from its route and computes a reconnecting
  path automatically.
- **Reporter location via SMS** — Sends a citizen reporter a one-tap link (PhilSMS) to
  share their exact location while filing a report.
- **Metrics & coverage** — Dashboards for response coverage per barangay and operational
  metrics.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** and **Node.js 18+**
- **PostgreSQL 14+** with the **PostGIS** extension enabled
- (Optional) An **ngrok** / dev-tunnel URL if you need the mobile app or SMS reporter
  links to reach your local backend
- (Optional) A **PhilSMS** API token to actually send SMS

---

## Running the backend

```bash
cd backend

# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate            # Windows (PowerShell/CMD)
# source venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux

# 2. Install PyTorch FIRST (match your hardware — see requirements.txt header)
#    CPU only:
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
#    Then install torch-geometric and the rest:
pip install torch-geometric
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure environment
copy .env.example .env           # then edit values (DATABASE_URL, tokens, PUBLIC_BASE_URL)

# 4. Create the database + PostGIS, then run migrations
#    (in psql:  CREATE DATABASE bfp_capstone;  \c bfp_capstone  CREATE EXTENSION postgis;)
alembic upgrade head

# 5. Seed baseline data (optional but recommended for a fresh DB)
python seed_admin.py
python seed_barangays.py
python seed_personnel.py
python seed_incidents.py

# 6. Run the API
python run.py                    # http://127.0.0.1:8000  (interactive docs at /docs)
```

To run with multiple workers for CPU-bound route rebuilds:

```bash
WEB_CONCURRENCY=4 python run.py
```

> ⚠️ Multi-worker mode does **not** share WebSocket connections or in-memory reporter
> sessions across processes yet — see the note at the top of `run.py` before enabling it
> in production.

## Switching regions (development only)

> **Production is always Panabo City.** FireOPS was built for and proposed to
> BFP Panabo City, and that is the only region it is ever deployed with. The
> region switch below exists purely so a developer can test the app — dispatch,
> routing, live tracking — without having to physically be in Panabo. It is a
> development convenience, not a multi-tenant or multi-city feature, and
> `REGION` should never be changed on a production deployment.

Panabo's road network is a **hand-digitised QGIS export** paired with the GAT
constraint predictions and hand-tuned routing multipliers. It is the real
dataset, it is never sourced from OSM, and nothing in the region switch touches
it.

New Corella is a throwaway stand-in pulled straight from OpenStreetMap, added
only so the developer isn't tied to one location while working:

```
GIS / Routing data
├── panabo       QGIS road network + GAT constraints   ← production (the real system)
└── new_corella  OSM road network, no constraints      ← developer testing only
```

In your **local** `.env` files, set **both** variables and restart. They must
name the same place, or the map shows one municipality while the router plans
over another. Leave both at `panabo` (or unset) everywhere else — that is the
shipped default, so a deployment that never sets `REGION` is always correct.

```bash
# backend/.env
REGION=new_corella
# frontend/.env
VITE_REGION=new_corella
```

`GET /api/routing/status` reports the live `region`, `road_source` and
`has_constraints` so you can confirm which dataset is loaded.

New Corella's data is already committed. To rebuild or add another OSM region
(declare it in `REGIONS` in `backend/ai/config.py` first):

```bash
cd backend
python fetch_osm_roads.py --region new_corella          # roads + boundary + barangays
python seed_barangays.py --clear                        # honours REGION
```

The script refuses any region whose `road_source` is not `osm`, so it cannot
overwrite Panabo's QGIS network.

**A dev region is deliberately a reduced environment.** It gets no GAT
constraint layer (the map's GNN-constraints panel 404s) and no routing
multipliers, so ALT plans on raw travel time; New Corella additionally has no
barangay polygons, because OSM has none mapped at `admin_level=10` there.
Incident logging still works — the by-barangay metrics and coverage-gap tables
just come back empty. You also need at least one **station with coordinates
inside the region**, or dispatch has no origin and `/api/coverage/*` returns
404. The database is shared across regions, so Panabo's stations and incidents
remain visible (far off-screen).

None of this is worth "fixing": the point is to exercise app behaviour away
from Panabo, not to stand up a second production system. Anything that depends
on the trained constraint model has to be validated against Panabo.
