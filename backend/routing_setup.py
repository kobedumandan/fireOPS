"""
Shared construction of the GeoAI routing engine.

Used both by the API lifespan (the main-process engine that serves the
/api/routing/* endpoints and the stale-driver watchdog) and by each
routing-pool worker process, so the two are guaranteed to load the same graph
and the same constraint weights.

Which dataset gets loaded is decided by the active region (see ai/config.py):
Panabo pairs its digitised QGIS network with GAT-predicted constraints, while
a testing region such as New Corella has an OSM network and no constraint
model at all.

Kept free of FastAPI/DB imports so pool subprocesses stay lightweight.
