"""
Response-coverage (reachability isochrone) computation.

Given the loaded routing graph and a set of source nodes (fire stations), runs a
multi-source Dijkstra on the SAME constraint-aware edge costs the router uses to
find how long a truck takes to reach every road. Reachable road segments are
bucketed into time bands (e.g. <=3 / <=5 / <=8 min); each band is turned into a
filled polygon by fattening (buffering) its reachable road lines and unioning
them. Per-barangay coverage percentages are then measured by intersecting each
band polygon with the barangay boundaries.

Pure graph/geometry math — no FastAPI/DB imports — so it is easy to test and can
be reused by a pool worker later. Blocked roads (infinite edge weight) are
skipped, so coverage honestly reflects what the routing engine can traverse.
