"""Process-wide mutable state shared by the routers and services.

Anything rebound at runtime (the routing engine, the process pool, the event
loop) lives here and MUST be read through the module — `state.routing_engine`,
never `from state import routing_engine` — so readers see the value lifespan
assigned. Objects that are only ever mutated in place (`manager`, the reporter
session dicts) are safe to import by name.
