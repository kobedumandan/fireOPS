"""
GeoAI Routing Engine — ties together the GNN models, RL agents,
NetworkX graph, and SUMO simulation into one callable interface
that the FastAPI endpoints will use.

Call flow for a dispatch request:
  1. Build/update RoadNetworkGraph from latest PostGIS data.
  2. Run GNN (GAT or PMGCN) to score every node → routing heat-map.
  3. ALT (A* with Landmarks and Triangle inequality) search on GNN-modulated
     edge costs finds the optimal route.
  4. Return route (WKT LINESTRING), ETA, and confidence score.
