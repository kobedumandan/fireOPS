"""Dispatch alerts to responders' phones: Expo push first, SMS as a fallback.

The mobile app only learns about a dispatch by polling and over the WebSocket,
and both stop when the phone sleeps. A push is what wakes it. Members who have
never registered a phone (or have push switched off in the app) get a PhilSMS
text instead, so nobody on the team is left relying on the app being open.

Sending runs as a fire-and-forget task after the dispatch has been committed:
a slow or failing push/SMS provider must never delay or fail the dispatch.
